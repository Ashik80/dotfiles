# Subagent Example

Delegate tasks to specialized subagents with isolated context windows.

## Features

- **Isolated context**: Each subagent runs in a separate `pi` process
- **Streaming output**: See the active tool and a live elapsed-time ticker in pi
- **Footer status**: See the aggregate number of active subagent processes
- **Per-agent transcripts**: Mirror live tool activity to an individually viewable log
- **Parallel streaming**: All parallel tasks stream updates simultaneously
- **Markdown rendering**: Final output rendered with proper formatting (expanded view)
- **Usage tracking**: Shows turns, tokens, cost, and context usage per agent
- **Abort support**: Ctrl+C propagates to kill subagent processes

```

## Installation

This fork is tracked in dotfiles so pi package upgrades cannot overwrite it.
Expose it to pi with one symlink:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent
```

Agent definitions and workflow prompts remain normal pi resources under
`~/.pi/agent/agents/` and `~/.pi/agent/prompts/`. The `agents/` and `prompts/`
directories here are reusable examples.

## Security Model

This tool executes a separate `pi` subprocess with a delegated system prompt and tool/model configuration.

**Project-local agents** (`.pi/agents/*.md`) are repo-controlled prompts that can instruct the model to read files, run bash commands, etc.

**Default behavior:** Only loads **user-level agents** from `~/.pi/agent/agents`.

To enable project-local agents, pass `agentScope: "both"` (or `"project"`). Only do this for repositories you trust.

When running interactively, the tool prompts for confirmation before running project-local agents in untrusted projects. Trusted projects skip the additional prompt. Set `confirmProjectAgents: false` to disable confirmation.

## Live subagent views

The fork mirrors each running subagent to:

```text
$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pi/subagent-views/session-<pid>/<agent>-<n>.log
```

`XDG_CACHE_HOME` defaults to `~/.cache`. Set `PI_SUBAGENT_VIEW=0` to
disable transcript mirroring. Files are mode `0600` inside a mode `0700`
session directory and are removed when the parent pi session exits.

The matching dotfiles Emacs configuration provides `M-x my/pi-subagent-views`
(or `C-c s v`). It prompts for one mirrored subagent, opens its transcript in
a ghostel side window, and follows new output with `tail -f`. Views are never
auto-opened.

The active subagent also remains visible inside pi. Its collapsed and expanded
tool cards show the current tool and update the elapsed-time counter once per
second. While child processes are active, pi's footer shows
`subagents: <count> running`; the indicator clears when the last process exits.

## Usage

### Single agent
```
Use scout to find all authentication code
```

### Parallel execution
```
Run 2 scouts in parallel: one to find models, one to find providers
```

### Chained workflow
```
Use a chain: first have scout find the read tool, then have planner suggest improvements
```

### Workflow prompts
```
/implement add Redis caching to the session store
/scout-and-plan refactor auth to support OAuth
/implement-and-review add input validation to API endpoints
```

## Tool Modes

| Mode | Parameter | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Single | `{ agent, task }` | One agent, one task |
| Parallel | `{ tasks: [...] }` | Multiple agents run concurrently (max 8, 4 concurrent) |
| Chain | `{ chain: [...] }` | Sequential with `{previous}` placeholder |

## Output Display

**Collapsed view** (default):
- Status icon (✓/✗/⏳) and agent name
- Last 5-10 items (tool calls and text)
- Usage stats: `3 turns ↑input ↓output RcacheRead WcacheWrite $cost ctx:contextTokens model`

**Expanded view** (Ctrl+O):
- Full task text
- All tool calls with formatted arguments
- Final output rendered as Markdown
- Per-task usage (for chain/parallel)

**Parallel mode streaming**:
- Shows all tasks with live status (⏳ running, ✓ done, ✗ failed)
- Updates as each task makes progress
- Shows "2/3 done, 1 running" status
- Returns each completed task's final output to the parent model, capped at 50 KB per task
- Returns failure diagnostics from stderr/error messages when a child exits before producing output

**Tool call formatting** (mimics built-in tools):
- `$ command` for bash
- `read ~/path:1-10` for read
- `grep /pattern/ in ~/path` for grep
- etc.

## Agent Definitions

Agents are markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: What this agent does
tools: read, grep, find, ls
model: claude-haiku-4-5
---

System prompt for the agent goes here.
```

When `model` is omitted, the subagent inherits the dispatching session's active model and thinking level.

**Locations:**
- `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` - User-level (always loaded)
- `.pi/agents/*.md` - Project-level (only with `agentScope: "project"` or `"both"`)

Project agents override user agents with the same name when `agentScope: "both"`.

## Sample Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Model | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| `scout` | Fast codebase recon | Haiku | read, grep, find, ls, bash |
| `planner` | Implementation plans | Sonnet | read, grep, find, ls |
| `reviewer` | Code review | Sonnet | read, grep, find, ls, bash |
| `worker` | General-purpose | Sonnet | (all default) |

## Workflow Prompts

| Prompt | Flow |
|--------|------|
| `/implement <query>` | scout → planner → worker |
| `/scout-and-plan <query>` | scout → planner |
| `/implement-and-review <query>` | worker → reviewer → worker |

## Error Handling

- **Exit code != 0**: Tool returns error with stderr/output
- **stopReason "error"**: LLM error propagated with error message
- **stopReason "aborted"**: User abort (Ctrl+C) kills subprocess, throws error
- **Chain mode**: Stops at first failing step, reports which step failed

## Limitations

- Output truncated to last 10 items in collapsed view (expand to see all)
- Parallel model-visible output is capped at 50 KB per task; full results remain in tool details
- Agents discovered fresh on each invocation (allows editing mid-session)
- Parallel mode limited to 8 tasks, 4 concurrent
